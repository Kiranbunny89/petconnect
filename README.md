I'm currently a student with Code:You and I'm interested in building a website that connects animals with families. We are required to build a website(s) that uses an external API for our project. This project interest me because animals deserves a better life than behind bars in a cage in a shelter. I hope I'm able to connect families with they new friends and give a pet a second chance.
